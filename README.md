# zzgunner

My stupid game for the N64 Game Jam 2021 :) The theme for this year was *Control*. See [Releases](https://github.com/Ryzee119/zzgunner/releases) for binary downloads.

The game is a "Dungeon Crawler"/"Rogue-Like" genre game. The objective is to regain control of your space ship which has been overrun by Alien robots.

## Brief
You have lost control of your ship. It has been overrun by Aliens and you must enable the self-defense system! Make your way to the bridge to re-enable it.
Unfortunately the ship has gone into lockdown. You must hit the 3 control pads on each floor to get to the next stage!

## Control scheme:
* D-Pad/C-Pad/Analog Stick = Move or Aim (Adjustable in game)
* L or A = Roll
* R or Z or B = Shoot

Recommend playing on real console or [Ares emulator](https://github.com/ares-emulator/ares/releases). This also works on [Cen64](https://github.com/n64dev/cen64) but performance is slow. Other emulators not fully tested.
