My stupid game for the N64 Game Jam 2021 :) The theme for this year was *Control*.

The game is a "Dungeon Crawler"/"Rogue-Like" genre game. The objective is to regain control of your space ship which has been overrun by Alien robots.

Control scheme:
* D-Pad = Move
* Analog Stick or C buttons = aim
* L = Roll
* R or Z = Shoot
